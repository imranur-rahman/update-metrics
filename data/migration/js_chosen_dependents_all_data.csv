of a concern, but it's still not to be ignored, particularly as we move into
worker environments.  More pressingly though, since this package will be
utilized by the `apollo` CLI, we'll be shaving precious download time off
the invocation of `npx apollo` if we can get this down.

* Update for Calypso repo

* Drop extraneous eslint extends

* Disallow import from cli

* Add cli/test eslint

* Update license

* Enable i18n tests

* Ignore .eslintrc.* from test matches

* Organize cli and bin

* Fix const eslint error

* Move expect into tests

* Remove gitignore

* Remove commented line

* Cleanup

* Prettier

* No es6 modules in cli

* Fix the translate call in getWebPaymentMethodName

The function calls method on a `i18n` object that doesn't exist as export in `i18n-calypso`:
```js
import { i18n } from 'i18n-calypso';
```
The result is a runtime exception.

`i18n-calypso` exports the `i18n` object as a default export and the `translate` bound method
as a named export.

Fixed by passing `translate` as a second parameter. That ensures that the translations are reactive,
i.e., the React UI is rerendered when locale is changed at runtime.

Includes also a drive-by fix for translation reactivity in `PaymentBox`.

* Expose emitter methods (on, off, emit) on the I18N class

Allows us to export a fully-functional `i18n` object as default export.

* Convert the module exports to ESM

* Convert the localize HOC to ES6 class

* Update ESM imports in i18n-calypso tests

* Update number-format source to contemporary standards

* Improve variable declaration style in I18N, move export to ESM

Declare variables at the place of first use or inside scoped blocks, as is common
in new code. Migrate the module to full ESM.

* Add hashbang comment to the CLI binary

* CLI: declare variables in more contemporary ES6 style, use object property shorthands

Variables are scoped or declared at the site of first use, the way new code tends to be written.

* Update the dependencies of i18n-calypso

Remove unused dependencies, require React 16, use one Lodash, harmonize versions
with parent package.

* Switch Calypso to use the local i18n-calypso package

* add a comment to the lint rules for the i18n cli to explain why

* add sideEffects: false to help tree-shaking

* Update and dedupe deps

This commit is the result of running:

npm run update-deps
npm dedupe

* move shrinkwrap back to tabs to cut down the diff

I'm avoiding using the central `gulp/index.js` to create a shared config in favor of configuring tasks explicitly with command line arguments that we parse in the script that npx/yarn executes.

* Build script builds javascript and runs the sass task, but the sass task doesn't seem to be working yet.

* Sass compiling works! And moved the executable script up a level because we're only going to have one now with different commands

* Improved logging and replaced our use of the deprecated gutil library with the recommended alternatives (https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-util-ca3b1f9f9ac5)

* Renamed `log-util.js` `logUtil.js` for consistency

* Stats work!

* Added some commented code for the next script/command to be written

* Clean up. I don't know where the name `dutil` came from, but it must be outdated. Removed unused stuff and cleaned up the logging. Also cleaned up the task definitions for the build module

* Calling the script `cmsds` and fixing a typo

* Moved fonts and images into the src folder and changed the build script to move fonts and images from src to dist. And when building child design systems (packages that aren't our core package), it will copy the fonts and images from the core package in node_modules into the child design system's dist folder.

* Clean up comment and allow fonts and images to be copied in parallel

* Added `skiplatest` support to the fonts stats function like we have for the css stats function and added helpful error messaging around skiplatest functionality. Instead of just throwing a bunch of filesystem errors, it will say why it errored and suggest using `--skiplatest` if appropriate.

* Build script copies sass files to dist as well now (but not the `*.docs.scss` ones)

* Updated comments documenting the different build tasks

* Got rid of a common file that doesn't need to exist anymore

* Pared it down to the files that are necessary for the source package build script only

* Renamed the scripts package folder to `design-system-scripts`

* A couple helper functions to clean the cli file up a bit.

* [WNMGDS-389] Add migration info to doc site (#650)

* Update readmes and documentation

* Reorganize CSS files

* Rename core folder to cmsds and update package.json

* Add back layout to docs package and fix broken links

* Add migration documentation

* PR feedback and other misc documentation changes

* Rename cmsds folder to design-system

* Remove core and layout dep from docs package

* Instead of using gulp tasks, we now just use async functions that have parameters. This makes it so much easier to compose them without having to preconfigure all the tasks with the right parameters, especially when certain parameters may or may not exist depending on which tasks you plan on using. This should be much simpler overall because it's just plain JavaScript. We still use gulp for the streaming transform pipelines, but at a high level, it's just JavaScript.

A note here that I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to consistently detect when a gulp stream had ended. It ended up being a combination of `{ readable: false, writeable: false }` for the `finished` function and placing the `pipe(count(...))` before the `pipe(gulp.dest(...))`. I tried a lot of different methods of detecting stream ends before I realized that it was a combination of those two things.

* Had to update babel and a few other dependencies to fix the build scripts

* Set up the command for building docs, and the `cmsds` script will now print usage if you don't specify a command or specify an invalid one

* Copied the docs scripts in and committing them as a baseline before I start changing them. Refactored the `gulp/webpack.js` module to not use gulp tasks

* Organizing the `gulp/docs` folder a bit more so it's easier to read

* Did a bunch of refactoring of the docs-building tasks, but then I realized that I was still dealing with an array of docs paths in most of these helper functions when I was specifically trying to avoid that. Will fix that next

* A bunch more refactoring. I have a lot of issues to work out still, but the basic structure should be here

* Make the design-system-docs package public so child design systems can include it as a dependency, and make the core package a peer dependency of the scripts package so we can ensure that's available for the build script

* Removed the dependency the docs build script had on a module shared with the docs package itself and fixed a bunch of errors. There are still more errors, but I'm making progress.

* Fixed some more build errors, but now I'm finding that the build path seems to be kind of hard-coded in a lot of places. I need to refactor a lot of these functions in gulp/docs to start their paths from the working directory rather than all these different locations relative to the root of the design-system repo. The nice thing about working out of just this temporary directory is that it should ultimately simplify all these different paths. I just need to untangle it

* Move `docs/index.js` into `docs/docs.js` so it's easier to tell what file I'm working on in my editor

* This commit is about getting the doc page rendering scripts to work, and there are several pieces to that:
- Get babel to work at runtime to import modules from the docs package. There was a problem where when npm-linking the scripts package and the docs package to the node_modules of the repository root we would get incompatible versions of babel. In the end I realized that we were importing `babel-register` which is the old babel 6 version. I had been importing `@babel/register` and didn't realize there was another import of the old package elsewhere. I made a lot of other changes to try to get this to work, but ultimately it was probably as simple as that
- Had to change a lot of paths. Some paths were relative to the module being executed, and some were relative to the cwd.
- Had to feed the github url to the docs package components another way because it needs to work for child design systems that are in other repos
- Changed imports of docs-package modules from using relative paths to treating the docs package as a dependency. It's now required for the docs package to be a peer dependency of the scripts package.
- Fixed other minor issues in the scripts

* Also compile docs package files with babel

* Fixed imports again and also realized that if I specify the path to the relative path to the current directory as the source directory for the script as `.`, I don't have to resolve the paths ahead of time, which keeps them short and sweet until a time when we absolutely need to resolve them to the absolute path.

* This function wasn't actually returning a promise, and this regex didn't cover the docs package if it was inside node_modules anymore. Also created an alias for the build script in the root package.json

* Fix merge mistake

* Fixed more merge mistakes

* Revert to the master version of all the backstop images. This is another merge error.

* Remove grid import from merge

* Remove copying to temp dir, as uniquePage in generatePages handles that already. Simplify copyAssets to be resuable in build-docs

* Fix error in processMarkup originating from processMarkup

* Run webpack statically for docs javascript, move webpack.config.js to design-system-scripts

* Remove postcss inliner and fix image copying

* Add compileDocSass and other misc fixes

* Move react data path to constants

* Move logic for processing core npm package into helper function, use it in tasks

* Add constant for design-system-docs package

* Automatically handle processing core docs for child DS cases

* Implement doc server, combine webpack files & update CLI

* Misc clean up

* Reorganize tasks to be more granular, updated options param to be used consistently, refactored webpack.config.js

The test is not testing parallell transactions anyway. However, IE11 is still unstable and hangs some times in the test suite. It still sometimes hang on simple tests as well. When that happens, I need to enter travis and restart the build. Still we need to test IE as long as it is supported.

_This PR is a combination of #31293 (the code changes) + #33570 (test updates). These two PRs were individually reviewed and merged into a feature branch. This combo PR here simply sets up the merge from the feature branch to `master`._

Summary of changes, taken from #31293:

## Before this PR
The Logstash Pipeline Viewer UI would make a single Kibana API call to fetch all the information necessary to render the Logstash pipeline. This included information necessary to render the detail drawer that opens up when a user clicks on an individual vertex in the pipeline.

Naturally, this single API call fetched _a lot_ of data, not just from the Kibana server but also, in turn, from Elasticsearch as well. The ""pro"" of this approach was that the user would see instantaneous results if they clicked on a vertex in a pipeline and opened the detail drawer for that vertex. The ""cons"" were the amount of computation Elasticsearch had to perform and the amount of data being transferred over the wire between Elasticsearch and the Kibana server as well as between the Kibana server and the browser.

## With this PR
This PR makes the Kibana API call to fetch data necessary for **initially** rendering the pipeline — that is, with the detail drawer closed — much lighter. When the user clicks on a vertex in a pipeline, a second API call is then made to fetch data necessary for the detail drawer.

## Gains, by the numbers

Based on a simple, 1-input, 1-filter, and 1-output pipeline.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses (multiple calls were made using the `composite` aggregation over the `date_histogram` aggregation) generated a total of 1228 aggregation buckets (before any `filter_path`s were applied but across all `composite` ""pages""). With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response (note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed) generated 12 buckets (also before any `filter_path`s were applied). That's a **99.02% reduction** in number of buckets.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses added up to 70319 bytes. With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response for the same pipeline is 746 bytes. That's a **98.93% reduction** in size.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_state` API response was 7718 bytes. With this PR, the API response for the same pipeline is 2328 bytes. That's a **69.83% reduction** in size.

* Before this PR the Kibana API response was 51777 bytes. With this PR, the API response for the same pipeline is 2567 bytes (again, note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed). That's a **95.04% reduction** in size.

_This PR is a combination of #31293 (the code changes) + #33570 (test updates). These two PRs were individually reviewed and merged into a feature branch. This combo PR here simply sets up the merge from the feature branch to `master`._

Summary of changes, taken from #31293:

## Before this PR
The Logstash Pipeline Viewer UI would make a single Kibana API call to fetch all the information necessary to render the Logstash pipeline. This included information necessary to render the detail drawer that opens up when a user clicks on an individual vertex in the pipeline.

Naturally, this single API call fetched _a lot_ of data, not just from the Kibana server but also, in turn, from Elasticsearch as well. The ""pro"" of this approach was that the user would see instantaneous results if they clicked on a vertex in a pipeline and opened the detail drawer for that vertex. The ""cons"" were the amount of computation Elasticsearch had to perform and the amount of data being transferred over the wire between Elasticsearch and the Kibana server as well as between the Kibana server and the browser.

## With this PR
This PR makes the Kibana API call to fetch data necessary for **initially** rendering the pipeline — that is, with the detail drawer closed — much lighter. When the user clicks on a vertex in a pipeline, a second API call is then made to fetch data necessary for the detail drawer.

## Gains, by the numbers

Based on a simple, 1-input, 1-filter, and 1-output pipeline.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses (multiple calls were made using the `composite` aggregation over the `date_histogram` aggregation) generated a total of 1228 aggregation buckets (before any `filter_path`s were applied but across all `composite` ""pages""). With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response (note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed) generated 12 buckets (also before any `filter_path`s were applied). That's a **99.02% reduction** in number of buckets.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses added up to 70319 bytes. With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response for the same pipeline is 746 bytes. That's a **98.93% reduction** in size.

_This PR is a combination of #31293 (the code changes) + #33570 (test updates). These two PRs were individually reviewed and merged into a feature branch. This combo PR here simply sets up the merge from the feature branch to `master`._

Summary of changes, taken from #31293:

## Before this PR
The Logstash Pipeline Viewer UI would make a single Kibana API call to fetch all the information necessary to render the Logstash pipeline. This included information necessary to render the detail drawer that opens up when a user clicks on an individual vertex in the pipeline.

Naturally, this single API call fetched _a lot_ of data, not just from the Kibana server but also, in turn, from Elasticsearch as well. The ""pro"" of this approach was that the user would see instantaneous results if they clicked on a vertex in a pipeline and opened the detail drawer for that vertex. The ""cons"" were the amount of computation Elasticsearch had to perform and the amount of data being transferred over the wire between Elasticsearch and the Kibana server as well as between the Kibana server and the browser.

## With this PR
This PR makes the Kibana API call to fetch data necessary for **initially** rendering the pipeline — that is, with the detail drawer closed — much lighter. When the user clicks on a vertex in a pipeline, a second API call is then made to fetch data necessary for the detail drawer.

## Gains, by the numbers

Based on a simple, 1-input, 1-filter, and 1-output pipeline.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses (multiple calls were made using the `composite` aggregation over the `date_histogram` aggregation) generated a total of 1228 aggregation buckets (before any `filter_path`s were applied but across all `composite` ""pages""). With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response (note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed) generated 12 buckets (also before any `filter_path`s were applied). That's a **99.02% reduction** in number of buckets.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses added up to 70319 bytes. With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response for the same pipeline is 746 bytes. That's a **98.93% reduction** in size.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_state` API response was 7718 bytes. With this PR, the API response for the same pipeline is 2328 bytes. That's a **69.83% reduction** in size.

* Before this PR the Kibana API response was 51777 bytes. With this PR, the API response for the same pipeline is 2567 bytes (again, note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed). That's a **95.04% reduction** in size.

We replaced the underlying AST extractor from babel to typescript. This
makes the extractor a lot more future-proof due to babel having to
constantly include new plugin/syntax while TS just works out of the box.
Future new syntax would just be TS upgrade.

BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `--messages-dir` option. This was primarily used
to eagerly write out output in the babel plugin since we don't know when
the execution will be done. This is not the case with the CLI.
`--out-file` should be used instead.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components (#5315)

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

- if provided --cert-file and --key-file paths are not real files, node gives a rejection

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

Thanks for creating Gatsby and for all of your hard work! We’ve enjoyed building our new marketing website with it.

* change link of `gatsby-advanced-blog` in docs

* Remove outdated contributing notes from gatsby-remark-prismjs

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

On mobile, the masthead is overlapping with the Gatsby icon.

* Update CONTRIBUTING.md

* Update README.md

* Add better-queue to dependencies

* Remove index.js for more consistent paths

* removing ""a""

* pre-inferring data sanitazation (#5050)

* extractFieldExamples: omit not defined fields

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

* Typo

* plugin-feed: Note feed xml file is production only (#5305)

Add note that the rss.xml feed is only generated in production.

* Fixing grammar around CSS Modules (#5286)

I don't know if it's the original article but at least it looks fairly similar

* added develop command options to use custom key and certs (#5056)

* added develop command options to use custom key and certs

* fixed typos in doc

* added condition to make sure both --key-file and --cert-file are present

* - passing https flag results in automatic https certs [devcert]
- --cert-file, --key-file, and --https flags can be used together for custom ssl
- if all flags needed for custom ssl are not present an error is displayed to the user
- if provided --cert-file and --key-file paths are not real files, node gives a rejection
- modified docs to express current behavior

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* pre-inferring data sanitazation (#5050)

* extractFieldExamples: omit not defined fields

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* Add bartvanderwaerden.com to showcase (#5152)

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

versions"" will always be building for them.

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled

unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* Hyperlinks, optionality, and ""easy"" (#5154)

Added a few changes. This document needs to be reorganized eventually; I just want to add these notes in the fastest way possible now so I don't forget them.

* Add bartvanderwaerden.com to showcase (#5152)

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

* flag importance of plugin order for prism-js vs embed-snippet (#5313)

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

* flag importance of plugin order for prism-js vs embed-snippet (#5313)

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components (#5315)

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

- if all flags needed for custom ssl are not present an error is displayed to the user
- if provided --cert-file and --key-file paths are not real files, node gives a rejection

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

Thanks for creating Gatsby and for all of your hard work! We’ve enjoyed building our new marketing website with it.

* change link of `gatsby-advanced-blog` in docs

* Remove outdated contributing notes from gatsby-remark-prismjs

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

On mobile, the masthead is overlapping with the Gatsby icon.

* Update CONTRIBUTING.md

* Update README.md

Per issue https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5073

* Add better-queue to dependencies

* Remove index.js for more consistent paths

* removing ""a""

* pre-inferring data sanitazation (#5050)

* extractFieldExamples: omit not defined fields

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* Add bartvanderwaerden.com to showcase (#5152)

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Better defaults for Typescript example

After running into multiple bugs having to deal with whether typescript was precompiling the same way that the babel version was (some include: jest testing, repl loading, mjs support) I realized that the big issue is that razzle had figured out solutions for each env based on webpack, so instead of having the added complexity of not knowing if I had proper typescript parody, I figured just remove that layer and use typescript for the one thing I wanted: type checking.

Happy to go into detail on those bugs, but I think the main point is this approach seems a better DX experiance out of the box, while offering more heavy solutions as comments.

This change migrates all the existing unit tests
- to Jest's global expect and matchers from chai's imported expect, asserts and matchers.
- to Jest's describe/test from mocha's describe/it

The majority of the mechanical changes to tests are achieved through running jest-codemods. The only two note-worthy manual tweaks:
1. Setting a testURL of http://localhost in jest config and adjusting a few tests to leverage this value instead of relying on about:blank.
2. Re-enabling ExploreChartPanel_spec which was previously commented out as we cannot have empty tests with nothing in it with Jest. :)

This change also removes dependencies to Mocha and Chai.

* Remove the test:one command as it now does the same thing as test.

* Fixing lint errors. The diff looks large but is large done through `yarn run lint --fix`

The only noteworthy change is the one in eslintrc for tests. The env has been updated from mocha to jest.

* Adding eslint-plugin-jest and further modify tests.

- One small fix in sqllab's Timer Spec for a test that is not using the spy it created for testing.
- Deletion of a duplicated test caught by eslint-plugin-jest.

* - Make istanbul coverage work with Jest.

- Remove dependency on stand-alone istanbul and babel-istanbul as they're built-into jest. Yes!

* Attempt to fix dynamic imports in tests.

* run sequentially and log heap usage

* - tweaking maxworkers for travis and specifying coverageDirectory for codecov

* Fixing lint errors. The diff looks large but is large done through `yarn run lint --fix`

The only noteworthy change is the one in eslintrc for tests. The env has been updated from mocha to jest.

* Adding eslint-plugin-jest and further modify tests.

- One small fix in sqllab's Timer Spec for a test that is not using the spy it created for testing.
- Deletion of a duplicated test caught by eslint-plugin-jest.

* - Make istanbul coverage work with Jest.

- Remove dependency on stand-alone istanbul and babel-istanbul as they're built-into jest. Yes!

* Attempt to fix dynamic imports in tests.

* run sequentially and log heap usage

* - tweaking maxworkers for travis and specifying coverageDirectory for codecov

- remove dynamic import in shim.js now that it is set in babelrc for tests only.",chai jest,"The only noteworthy change is the one in eslintrc for tests.

* Enable shared code between /web and /server

Until now, we've been able to share types from /common to both our
/server and /web codebases. However, importing any code into /server
from /common that wasn't stripped out by TypeScript (so, anything but
types), caused our directory structure to change. It broke the build
in a non-obvious way, and has been a frustrating limitation.

I've slowly and surely been upgrading our Webpack / TypeScript
dependencies, which was part of the puzzle.

This commit turns our /common directory into a proper standalone module,
with a single generated index.ts file, a build step, and type
annotations.

For consistency, we now rely on [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) on both the /web and /server packages. Treating /common as a standalone module has encapsulation benefits, and will let us manage a separate dependency list, build steps, etc. for /common.

In the process of doing this work I realized that we have a lot of (near) options for solving this task. Here are a few off the top of my head:

- Yarn Workspaces
- Yarn / NPM Private Packages
- Yarn link
- ""file: ../"" dependencies
- TypeScript Project References
- TypeScript Internal Modules
- TypeScript Path Aliases
- TypeScript Path Mapping (different thing)
- Lerna
- Oh… have I not even mentioned webpack yet?

We already using some of these, which made the task frustrating. The goal is to pick a subset that works for us, and strictly stick to that subset.

This commit also adds some trivial `real code` imports into /server,
so we can test it out right away.

For quick checks, I found the following adequate:

`cd server && tsc -b && cd ../web && yarn build`

or,

`cd server && yarn start` (tests whether node / commonjs imports are
finding /common imports)

or,

`cd common && tsc`

To run a final test of this change, I wanted to be sure that things would work
from scratch. The test plan below is a bit overkill, and it will take a while,
but it was worth the peace of mind.

```
docker ps -a
# docker kill/rm related processes
docker images
# docker rmi the voice-web image
rm -rf web/node_modules/ server/node_modules/ node_modules/ web/dist/ server/js common/js common/index.ts

## Description
Webpack requires `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin@1.x`. thus `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin@2.x` may not resolve correctly. Also, the webpack team decided to go with `terser-webpack-plugin` (https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/8036).

Summary:

This is the first step in an effort to convert javascript SDK from Common JS to ES Module. The changes include
1. Convert all the entry point files to ES Module.
2. Minified Common JS bundles are being created for each entry point using Rollup and Terser
main: dist/optimizely.node.min.js
browser: dist/optimizely.browser.min.js
react-native: dist/optimizely.react_native.min.js
3. All the bundles including umd bundle are generated using Rollup and terser. Webpack is only being used to keep the Karma tests running.

Why Webpack for Karma?

We tried using Rollup with Karma for the same purpose but couldnt run it despite trying many times. To not block progress on the ES module conversion, we recommend moving forward with using webpack to keep running karma tests when all the bundles are being created by Rollup and terser. We can revisit and modify Karma to use Rollup later. 

Note about Testapp:

This PR uses a specific branch of javascript-testapp. This change is required because now testapp has to run an additional command to build the bundles which was not the case earlier. This testapp PR needs to be merged before merging this SDK branch.
https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-testapp/pull/83

Test plan:
All unit tests and Full stack compatibility suite tests pass.

## Description

This PR combines three others (#1273, #1280, #1291) and rewrites Gesture Handler and examples to TS.
We tried to make non-breaking changes but this should be tested.

Most types were overhauled, although they should remain compatible with old ones thanks to the type aliases in the `src/handlers/gestureHandlerTypesCompat.ts` file.

CI for iOS was disabled due to strange fails. It should be reenabled when we add unit/e2e tests to RNGH.

Fixes #1076 - removed Flow from DrawerLayout
Fixes #1261 - added TS types
Fixes #998 - regenerated example app
Fixes #887 - removed prop types

## Changes

### Package packing, configs & source code

- Swipeable and DrawerLayout are now resolved by their own `package.json`s
- React Native uses source code directly, browser and TS use files from `dist/`
- Removed prop types

#### Internal

- Removed unused babel config in the root dir, adjust Eslint config
- Removed unused functions
- Changed private names from `_name` to `private name`
- Replaced `x && x()` syntax with `x.?()`

### Types

- Added types compatibility layer for the new types (`gestureHandlerTypesCompat.ts`)
- Added generation of declarations and declarations map when TS is transpiled
- Moved types from declaration files to files with implementation
- Added types to Android / iOS / shared JS code
- Added basic types to the web version

### Example app

- Removed unused bits in examples
- Regenerated Example app with latest RN
- Removed stray files from examples/
- Updated Travis config to include newer Android build tools & iOS scheme name change
- Organized Example code structure
- Removed Example tests (they weren't testing anything)
- Reconfigured web version of examples

## Testing

PRs that were merged into `ts-rewrite` branch were tested by using `npm pack` and adding it to the new app. In the case of #1273 & #1280, we additionally checked bundled diff for changes.

We diffed master to generated dist/ directory using `diff --color -wryN -W 200 src/ dist/src`with imports removed by `find src -name ""*.js"" -type f -exec sed -i '' '/import/d' {} \;`

## Description

This PR combines three others (#1273, #1280, #1291) and rewrites Gesture Handler and examples to TS.
We tried to make non-breaking changes but this should be tested.

Most types were overhauled, although they should remain compatible with old ones thanks to the type aliases in the `src/handlers/gestureHandlerTypesCompat.ts` file.

CI for iOS was disabled due to strange fails. It should be reenabled when we add unit/e2e tests to RNGH.

Fixes #1076 - removed Flow from DrawerLayout
Fixes #1261 - added TS types
Fixes #998 - regenerated example app
Fixes #887 - removed prop types
