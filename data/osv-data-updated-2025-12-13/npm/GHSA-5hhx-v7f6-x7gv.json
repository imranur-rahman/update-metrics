Exploiting this would have required a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory running Yarn 3.0 or above. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to Benjamin Faller, Redguard AG and Michael Hess for reporting this issue!","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@anthropic-ai/claude-code","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40anthropic-ai/claude-code"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.39"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-5hhx-v7f6-x7gv/GHSA-5hhx-v7f6-x7gv.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/security/advisories/GHSA-5hhx-v7f6-x7gv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65099"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-19T20:33:10Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-19T18:15:51Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}]}
